/* 
The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where
 each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once 
 in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the 
 original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a 
 duplicate.

Examples:
 
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))(("

charCount[char]:

This accesses the current count of the character char in the charCount object.
If char is not yet a property of charCount, this expression evaluates to undefined.
charCount[char] || 0:

This part uses the logical OR (||) operator.
If charCount[char] is undefined (or any falsy value like null or 0), it will default to 0.
This ensures that if the character char hasnâ€™t been counted yet, it starts with a count of 0.
(charCount[char] || 0) + 1:

After evaluating to 0 if charCount[char] was undefined, the expression adds 1.
This increments the count of the character by 1.
charCount[char] =:

Finally, this assigns the new count back to the charCount object for the property corresponding to the character char.
